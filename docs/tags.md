Tags
========================
Introduction
------------
Along with accessing objects, Noodles tags can be used to utilize methods or "macros". Certain keywords, thus, cannot be utilized as object names. In addition to this list there may be extra "plugins" that provide additional macro-functionality. Most of the tags are self-contained, but a few like "if" and "loop" are control-flow tags that render blocks of text.
