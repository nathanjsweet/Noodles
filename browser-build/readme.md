Browser Build
-------------
If you are using Noodles on the browser you might want to use this minified and compiled version of the file (the Noodles core is contained in this one file). To see an example of how to use the minified version look at the file "tests/browsers-test-using-build.html". In order to rebuild this index file run the following code:
	
	node node_modules/r/dist/r.js -o lib/app.build.js
